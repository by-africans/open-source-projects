## Guidelines

1. The project should be an open source project. (Do well to have a well outlined contribution procedure to help others easily contribute)

2. Verify that the project yet to be added does not already exist in the project list.

    - You can easily verify from the  **[website](https://opensource.byafricans.org/)** by searching for the project name with additional filters if required.

    - Or open the **[projects.json](https://github.com/by-africans/open-source-projects/blob/master/projects.json)** and search through.

3. Ensure that you are the rightful owner/author of the project yet to be added. If you are a contributor/maintainer or any other, ensure you have been permitted to share the projet on this platform.

4. In **[projects.json](https://github.com/by-africans/open-source-projects/blob/master/projects.json)**, add a `JSON` entry of the project.

    - Your `JSON` entry should have :
        - Project name
        - URL to your Github project repository
        - Project description
        - Github Username
        - Author's country of origin (Must be African)
        - Twitter handle

    - Example of a `JSON` entry:

        ```json
        {
            "name": "made-in-africa",
            "github_url": "https://github.com/by-africans/open-source-projects",
